### GetMX Compared to ForwardMX/ImprovMX

GetMX differs from forwarding email services. ForwardMX/ImprovMX only handles email forwarding via cheap bandwidth to the email address you set. However, this has drawbacks: receiving too many emails may cause rejection, leading to lost emails, which can significantly impact business. Once an email is rejected, the sender may never attempt to resend, causing lost accounts registered with those emails on platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, Google, PayPal, etc. Many users have migrated from ForwardMX/ImprovMX to GetMX due to this issue, but the consequence of being unable to receive emails is irreversible.
